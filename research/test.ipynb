Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\nOverview \\nWe offer products and services des igned to empower organization s across the semiconductor and electronics \\necosystems to connect, collect, manage, and analyze data about design, equipment, manufacturing, and test to improve the \\nyield and quality of their produc ts. We derive revenues from tw o sources: Analytics and In tegrated Yield Ramp. Our \\nofferings combine proprietary software, professional services u sing proven methodologies and third-party cloud-hosting \\nplatforms for SaaS, electrical m easurement hardware tools, and physical IP for IC designs. We primarily monetize our \\nofferings through license fees and contract fees for profession al services and SaaS. In some cases, especially on our \\nhistorical Integrated Yield Ramp  engagements, we also receive a  value-based variable fee or royalty, which we call \\nGainshare. Our products, services, and solutions have been sold  to IDMs, fabless semiconductor companies, foundries, \\nOSATs, capital equipment manufacturers and system houses. \\nIndustry Trends \\nCertain trends may affect our Analytics revenue specifically. I n particular, the confluence of Industry 4.0 (i.e. the \\nfourth industrial revolution, or the automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes) and cloud \\ncomputing (i.e. the on-demand availability of computing resources and data storage without direct active management by \\nthe user) is driving increased innovation in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing and analytics, as well as in the \\norganization of information technology (“IT”) networks and computing at semiconductor and electronics companies across \\nthe ecosystem. First, the ubiquity of wireless connectivity and sensor technology enables any manufacturing company to \\naugment its factories and visualize its entire production line. In parallel, the cost per terabyte of data storage has generally \\ndecreases over time. The combination of these two trends means that more data is collected and stored than ever before. \\nFurther, semiconductor companies are striving to analyze these very large data sets in real-time to make rapid decisions \\nthat measurably improve manufacturing efficiency and quality. In parallel, the traditional practice of on-site data storage, \\neven for highly sensitive data, is changing. The ability to cost-effectively and securely store, analyze, and retrieve massive \\nquantities of data from the cloud versus on-premise enables data to be utilized across a much broader population of users, \\nfrequently resulting in greater demands on analytics programs. The combination of these latter two trends means that \\ncloud-based, analytic programs that effectively manage identity  management, physical secur ity, and data protection are \\nincreasingly in demand for insights and efficiencies across the organizations of these companies. We believe that all these \\ntrends will continue for the next few years, and the challenges  involved in adopting Industry 4.0 and secure cloud \\ncomputing will create opportunities for our combination of adva nced analytics capabilities, proven and established \\nsupporting infrastructure, and professional services to configure our products to meet customers’ specialized needs.
